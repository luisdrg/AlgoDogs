# Reflection

I only had a few hours to complete this project, but I still wanted to submit something instead of nothing. I didn’t want to overthink it, so I just focused on making something simple that actually works. I also wanted to have a little fun with it, especially with our class saying of “the algorithm provides.”

# What worked

The Flask app works. I was able to set up a route, make a POST request, call an external API, and show the result on the page. Using the dog API made it easy to see results right away, which helped me know the app was actually doing something. Adding a CSS file also made it feel more like a real web app and not just raw HTML.

# What didn’t work

Some small things took longer than expected, especially dealing with templates and static files, I had to look up documentation because I kept having a typo and was too stubborn to use AI.

# What I learned

I learned to commit and push often even if they were not big changes. I usually have a bad habit of not doing that, but this project forced me to do that so I can show my progress more clearly.
